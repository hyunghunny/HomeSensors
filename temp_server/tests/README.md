README for test cases:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This folder includes test cases for testing Node.JS samples.
NodeUnit is used for testing these test cases so you SHOULD install it before you test it as follows:

  npm install nodeunit -g

Now, you can run these cases as follows:

  nodeunit {name of test case file}.js
